# Java Primitive Types #

## 1. Introduction ##
Java is a statically-typed language. This means, one must declare a variable before it can be used. The data type, as the name says, represents the type of value or data stored in a variable. Neither it is an object nor does it contains states of other primitive data types.

For instance, 

```java
int integer\_variable = 2;
float float\_variable = 2.21f;
char character\_variable = 'c';
```

In the above code, we declare three variables of type `int`, `float` and `char` respectively. These data types only accept those values which are compatible with them.
In other words we cannot assign `2.21f` to `character\_variable` likewise `'c'` to `float\_variable`. A compile error is generated if types mismatch. However we can bypass this by casting values to those data types which are compatible.

In Java, there are **8** primitive data types. Each of these types are explained in **Section 2**.
